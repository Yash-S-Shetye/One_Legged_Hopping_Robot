# One_Legged_Hopping_Robot
Codes for simulating a one-legged hopping robot in MATLAB. To simulate the model, The following steps need to be carried out to run the simulation.

1.) Put both files ‘main_code.m’ and ‘draw.m’ in the same folder.

2.)Run ‘main_code.m’ which automatically calls the 'draw.m' file and runs the simulation showing all 
the relevant plots and an animation of the robot in action.
